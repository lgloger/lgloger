## Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>
I’m [**Luca**](https://www.lucagloger.pages.dev), a Front-End Web Developer.
I love creating clean, responsive user interfaces and turning ideas into smooth, interactive web experiences.
My main tech stack is HTML, CCS and javascript.
I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the **COMING SOON**.
I like trying out new ideas, improving my code, and learning anything that helps me build better websites.
